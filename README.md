This is my updated portfolio which shows my progress of becoming a web developer after two months. In this portfolio, there is a small introduction of who I am and how I believe I am a competitive employee in web development. I showcase 3 projects of mine that I think are the best among all of them. Repositories and links to the page have been included in the portfolio's deployed site. I have also attached an update resume that expresses my strongest qualities in web design, along with link to my Github and LinkedIn profiles. Other contacts have been added such as my email and phone number for any inquiries.
